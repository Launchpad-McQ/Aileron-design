# flapstest
## What it does:
  Helps you to calculate your aileron position and size for airplanes in small reynolds numbers (limitation of xfoil) such as RC planes.
  
## How to use:
1. Put flapstest.py in same folder as your airfoil .dat file, xfoil.exe or (xfoil.app for mac os x users).
1. Run the python script and it will be self explanatory. (Written in python 2.7)

* If you want to design ailerons you want "Upper delta limit" to be your maximum downward aileron angle and "Lower delta limit" to be close to your maximum downward aileron angle.
