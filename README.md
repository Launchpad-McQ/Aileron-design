# flapstest
## What it does:
  Helps you to calculate your aileron position and size for airplanes in small reynolds numbers (limitation of xfoil) such as RC planes.
  
## How to use:
1. Put flapstest.py in same folder as your airfoil.dat file, xfoil.exe or (xfoil.app for mac os x users).

  (You can find airfoil.dat files at airfoiltools.com)
  
1. Run the python script and it will be self explanatory. (Written in python 2.7)

  (You can skip input and use default by just pressing enter when prompted for input)

* If you want to design ailerons you want "Upper delta limit" to be your maximum downward aileron angle and "Lower delta limit" to be close to your maximum downward aileron angle.
