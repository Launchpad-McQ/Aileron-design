# flapstest
* What it does:
  Helps you to calculate your aileron position and size.
* How to use:
1. Put flapstest.py in same folder as your airfoil .dat file, xfoil.exe or (xfoil.app for mac os x users).
1. Run the python script and it will be self explanatory.

* If you want to design ailerons you want "Upper delta limit" to be your maximum downward aileron angle and "Lower delta limit" to be close to your maximum downward aileron angle.
